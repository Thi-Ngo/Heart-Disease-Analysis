Heart Disease Analysis

Heart disease is one of the most popular causes of death for Americans. More than 30 million US adults are diagnosed with heart disease, and about 650,000 Americans die every year.

In this analysis, the work examined data on heart disease patients to identify factors that may be associated with an increased risk of heart disease.
The study included 302 patients, with 206 males and 96 females. The findings showed that high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and low fasting sugar were the most significant risk factors for heart disease. 

Based on these results, it is recommended that individuals focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and a balanced diet, to help reduce their risk of heart disease
